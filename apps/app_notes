Notes on App development -

1/ Android/Apple takes from few hours to maximum up to 2 days to accept published app after their review. Google reviews are probably automated but Apple is manual.
2/ We can consider publishing the app through different marketplaces not just Google play.
3/ To publish to the app, we need -
 — Title (* decided already)
 — Short Desc
 — Full Desc
 — App Screenshots(JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha))(Min-2,Max-8)(Min-320px,Max-3840px)
 — Hi-res icon(512 x 512)(32-bit PNG (with alpha))
 — Feature Graphic(1024 w x 500 h)(JPG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha))
 — App Type
 — Category (* Should be Finance/Business)
 — Content Rating (* Should be Everyone)
 — Developer/Company Email (* Known)
 — Privacy Policy Url (* already created)
 — And some other details like if the app is paid or free...(* Should be free).

4/ Signing the app with a key. Was this key shared to you for the first app ?

To keep the app under the review radar, 
- Best to adjust the description as well as screenshots and create fresh icons for each app. 
- For providing the required screenshots, using different pages to showcase the app should be sufficient. 
- For the icons, we have to build each individually.
- Apps are typically searched for by users by key words and app types.
- Why android 5 and above only ?
- Overall, gathering and creating images is a specialized job - takes specific skills !
